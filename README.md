# Publish Markdown files to Confluence wiki

Contributors to software projects typically write documentation in Markdown format and host Markdown files in collaborative version control systems (VCS) such as GitHub or GitLab to track changes and facilitate the review process. However, not everyone at a company has access to VCS, and documents are often circulated in Confluence wiki instead.

Replicating documentation to Confluence by hand is tedious, and a lack of automated synchronization with the project repositories where the documents live leads to outdated documentation.

This Python package

* parses Markdown files,
* converts Markdown content into the Confluence Storage Format (XHTML),
* invokes Confluence API endpoints to upload images and content.

## Features

* Sections and subsections
* Text with **bold**, *italic*, `monospace`, <ins>underline</ins> and ~~strikethrough~~
* Link to [sections on the same page](#getting-started) or [external locations](http://example.com/)
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Code blocks (e.g. Python, JSON, XML)
* Images (uploaded as Confluence page attachments or hosted externally)
* Tables
* [Table of contents](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/markdown.html#table-of-contents)
* [Admonitions](https://python-markdown.github.io/extensions/admonition/) and alert boxes in [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#alerts) and [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/styleguide/#alert-boxes)
* [Collapsed sections](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/organizing-information-with-collapsed-sections)
* [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.live/) in code blocks (converted to images)

Whenever possible, the implementation uses [Confluence REST API v2](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v2/) to fetch space properties, and get, create or update page content.

## Installation

**Required.** Install the core package from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/markdown-to-confluence/):

```sh
pip install markdown-to-confluence
```

**Optional.** Converting code blocks of Mermaid diagrams into Confluence image attachments requires [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli):

```sh
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli
```

## Getting started

In order to get started, you will need

* your organization domain name (e.g. `example.atlassian.net`),
* base path for Confluence wiki (typically `/wiki/` for managed Confluence, `/` for on-premise)
* your Confluence username (e.g. `levente.hunyadi@instructure.com`) (only if required by your deployment),
* a Confluence API token (a string of alphanumeric characters), and
* the space key in Confluence (e.g. `SPACE`) you are publishing content to.

### Obtaining an API token

1. Log in to <https://id.atlassian.com/manage/api-tokens>.
2. Click *Create API token*.
3. From the dialog that appears, enter a memorable and concise *Label* for your token and click *Create*.
4. Click *Copy to clipboard*, then paste the token to your script, or elsewhere to save.

### Setting up the environment

Confluence organization domain, base path, username, API token and space key can be specified at runtime or set as Confluence environment variables (e.g. add to your `~/.profile` on Linux, or `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshenv` on MacOS):

```bash
export CONFLUENCE_DOMAIN='example.atlassian.net'
export CONFLUENCE_PATH='/wiki/'
export CONFLUENCE_USER_NAME='levente.hunyadi@instructure.com'
export CONFLUENCE_API_KEY='0123456789abcdef'
export CONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEY='SPACE'
```

On Windows, these can be set via system properties.

### Permissions

The tool requires appropriate permissions in Confluence in order to invoke endpoints.

If a Confluence username is set, the tool uses HTTP *Basic* authentication to pass the username and the API key to Confluence REST API endpoints. If no username is provided, the tool authenticates with HTTP *Bearer*, and passes the API key as the bearer token.

If you lack appropriate permissions, you will get an *Unauthorized* response from Confluence. The tool will emit a message that looks as follows:

```
2023-06-30 23:59:59,000 - ERROR - <module> [80] - 401 Client Error: Unauthorized for url: ...
```

### Associating a Markdown file with a wiki page

Each Markdown file is associated with a Confluence wiki page with a Markdown comment:

```markdown
<!-- confluence-page-id: 85668266616 -->
```

The above tells the tool to synchronize the Markdown file with the given Confluence page ID. This implies that the Confluence wiki page must exist such that it has an ID. The comment can be placed anywhere in the source file.

### Setting the Confluence space

If you work in an environment where there are multiple Confluence spaces, and some Markdown pages may go into one space, whereas other pages may go into another, you can set the target space on a per-document basis:

```markdown
<!-- confluence-space-key: SPACE -->
```

This overrides the default space set via command-line arguments or environment variables.

### Setting generated-by prompt text for wiki pages

In order to ensure readers are not editing a generated document, the tool adds a warning message at the top of the Confluence page as an *info panel*. You can customize the text that appears. The text can contain markup as per the [Confluence Storage Format](https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/confluence-storage-format-790796544.html), and is emitted directly into the *info panel* macro.

Provide generated-by prompt text in the Markdown file with a tag:

```markdown
<!-- generated-by: Do not edit! Check out the <a href="https://example.com/project">original source</a>. -->
```

Alternatively, use the `--generated-by GENERATED_BY` option. The tag takes precedence.

### Publishing a single page

*md2conf* has two modes of operation: *single-page mode* and *directory mode*.

In single-page mode, you specify a single Markdown file as the source, which can contain absolute links to external locations (e.g. `https://example.com`) but not relative links to other pages (e.g. `local.md`). In other words, the page must be stand-alone.

### Publishing a directory

*md2conf* allows you to convert and publish a directory of Markdown files rather than a single Markdown file in *directory mode* if you pass a directory as the source. This will traverse the specified directory recursively, and synchronize each Markdown file.

First, *md2conf* builds an index of pages in the directory hierarchy. The index maps each Markdown file path to a Confluence page ID. Whenever a relative link is encountered in a Markdown file, the relative link is replaced with a Confluence URL to the referenced page with the help of the index. All relative links must point to Markdown files that are located in the directory hierarchy.

If a Markdown file doesn't yet pair up with a Confluence page, *md2conf* creates a new page and assigns a parent. Parent-child relationships are reflected in the navigation panel in Confluence. You can set a root page ID with the command-line option `-r`, which constitutes the topmost parent. (This could correspond to the landing page of your Confluence space. The Confluence page ID is always revealed when you edit a page.) Whenever a directory contains the file `index.md` or `README.md`, this page becomes the future parent page, and all Markdown files in this directory (and possibly nested directories) become its child pages (unless they already have a page ID). However, if an `index.md` or `README.md` file is subsequently found in one of the nested directories, it becomes the parent page of that directory, and any of its subdirectories.

The concepts above are illustrated in the following sections.

#### File-system directory hierarchy

The title of each Markdown file (either the text of the topmost unique heading (`#`), or the title specified in front-matter) is shown next to the file name.

```
.
├── computer-science
│   ├── index.md: Introduction to computer science
│   ├── algebra.md: Linear algebra
│   └── algorithms.md: Theory of algorithms
└── machine-learning
    ├── README.md: AI and ML
    ├── awareness.md: Consciousness and intelligence
    └── statistics
        ├── index.md: Introduction to statistics
        └── median.md: Mean vs. median
```

#### Page hierarchy in Confluence

Observe how `index.md` and `README.md` files have assumed parent (or ancestor) role for any Markdown files in the same directory (or below).

```
root
├── Introduction to computer science
│   ├── Linear algebra
│   └── Theory of algorithms
└── AI and ML
    ├── Consciousness and intelligence
    └── Introduction to statistics
        └── Mean vs. median
```

### Lists and tables

If your Markdown lists or tables don't appear in Confluence as expected, verify that the list or table is delimited by a blank line both before and after, as per strict Markdown syntax. While some previewers accept a more lenient syntax (e.g. an itemized list immediately following a paragraph), *md2conf* uses [Python-Markdown](https://python-markdown.github.io/) internally to convert Markdown into XHTML, which expects the Markdown document to adhere to the stricter syntax.

### Publishing images

Local images referenced in a Markdown file are automatically published to Confluence as attachments to the page.

Unfortunately, Confluence struggles with SVG images, e.g. they may only show in *edit* mode, display in a wrong size or text labels in the image may be truncated. (This seems to be a known issue in Confluence.) In order to mitigate the issue, whenever *md2conf* encounters a reference to an SVG image in a Markdown file, it checks whether a corresponding PNG image also exists in the same directory, and if a PNG image is found, it is published instead.

External images referenced with an absolute URL retain the original URL.

### Ignoring files

Skip files in a directory with rules defined in `.mdignore`. Each rule should occupy a single line. Rules follow the syntax (and constraints) of [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html#fnmatch.fnmatch). Specifically, `?` matches any single character, and `*` matches zero or more characters. For example, use `up-*.md` to exclude Markdown files that start with `up-`. Lines that start with `#` are treated as comments.

Files that don't have the extension `*.md` are skipped automatically. Hidden directories (whose name starts with `.`) are not recursed into.

Relative paths to items in a nested directory are not supported. You must put `.mdignore` in the same directory where the items to be skipped reside.

### Page title

*md2conf* makes a best-effort attempt at setting the Confluence wiki page title when it publishes a Markdown document the first time. The following are probed in this order:

1. The `title` attribute set in the [front-matter](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/what-exactly-is-frontmatter/). Front-matter is a block delimited by `---` at the beginning of a Markdown document. Currently, only YAML syntax is supported.
2. The text of the topmost unique Markdown heading (`#`). For example, if a document has a single first-level heading (e.g. `# My document`), its text is used. However, if there are multiple first-level headings, this step is skipped.
3. The file name (without the extension `.md`).

If a matching Confluence page already exists for a Markdown file, the page title in Confluence is left unchanged.

### Converting diagrams

You can include [Mermaid diagrams](https://mermaid.js.org/) in your Markdown documents to create visual representations of systems, processes, and relationships. When a Markdown document contains a code block with the language specifier `mermaid`, *md2conf* offers two options to publish the diagram:

1. Pre-render into an image. The code block is interpreted by and converted into a PNG or SVG image with the Mermaid diagram utility [mermaid-cli](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid-cli). The generated image is then uploaded to Confluence as an attachment to the page. This is the approach we use and support.
2. Render on demand. The code block is transformed into a [diagram macro](https://atlasauthority.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/MARKDOWNCLOUD/pages/2946826241/Diagram+Macro), which is processed by Confluence. You need a [Confluence plugin](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211438/markdown-html-plantuml-latex-diagrams-open-api-mermaid) to turn macro definitions into images when a Confluence page is visited. This is a contributed feature. As authors of *md2conf*, we don't endorse or support any particular Confluence plugin.

### Running the tool

You execute the command-line tool `md2conf` to synchronize the Markdown file with Confluence:

```sh
$ python3 -m md2conf sample/index.md
```

Use the `--help` switch to get a full list of supported command-line options:

```console
$ python3 -m md2conf --help
usage: md2conf [-h] [--version] [-d DOMAIN] [-p PATH] [-u USERNAME] [-a APIKEY] [-s SPACE] [-l {debug,info,warning,error,critical}] [-r ROOT_PAGE] [--keep-hierarchy] [--generated-by GENERATED_BY] [--no-generated-by]
               [--render-mermaid] [--no-render-mermaid] [--render-mermaid-format {png,svg}] [--heading-anchors] [--ignore-invalid-url] [--local] [--headers [KEY=VALUE ...]] [--webui-links]
               mdpath

```

### Using the Docker container

You can run the Docker container via `docker run` or via `Dockerfile`. Either can accept the environment variables or arguments similar to the Python options. The final argument `./` corresponds to `mdpath` in the command-line utility.

With `docker run`, you can pass Confluence domain, user, API and space key directly to `docker run`:

```sh
docker run --rm --name md2conf -v $(pwd):/data leventehunyadi/md2conf:latest -d example.atlassian.net -u levente.hunyadi@instructure.com -a 0123456789abcdef -s SPACE ./
```

Alternatively, you can use a separate file `.env` to pass these parameters as environment variables:

```sh
docker run --rm --env-file .env --name md2conf -v $(pwd):/data leventehunyadi/md2conf:latest ./
```

In each case, `-v $(pwd):/data` maps the current directory to Docker container's `WORKDIR` such *md2conf* can scan files and directories in the local file system.

Note that the entry point for the Docker container's base image is `ENTRYPOINT ["python3", "-m", "md2conf"]`.

With the `Dockerfile` approach, you can extend the base image:

```Dockerfile
FROM leventehunyadi/md2conf:latest

ENV CONFLUENCE_DOMAIN='example.atlassian.net'
ENV CONFLUENCE_PATH='/wiki/'
ENV CONFLUENCE_USER_NAME='levente.hunyadi@instructure.com'
ENV CONFLUENCE_API_KEY='0123456789abcdef'
ENV CONFLUENCE_SPACE_KEY='SPACE'

CMD ["./"]
```

Alternatively,

```Dockerfile
FROM leventehunyadi/md2conf:latest

CMD ["-d", "example.atlassian.net", "-u", "levente.hunyadi@instructure.com", "-a", "0123456789abcdef", "-s", "SPACE", "./"]
```
