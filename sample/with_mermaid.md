[Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/)  is a simple and powerful diagramming
and charting tool that uses a markdown-like syntax.

You can include Mermaid diagrams in your
documents to create visual representations of systems, processes,
and relationships.

There are two options for rendering Mermaid diagrams in Confluence:

1. Inline the Mermaid diagrams directly in the Confluence page. This requires installing the [Markdown HTML PlantUML LaTeX Diagrams Open API Mermaid](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1211438/markdown-html-plantuml-latex-diagrams-open-api-mermaid?hosting=cloud&tab=overview) plugin into your Confluence account.

2. Render the Mermaid diagrams using the [Kroki](https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/architecture/) server. This option does not require installing any additional plugins in Confluence.  By default, the public server at https://kroki.io is used. You can choose to [install your a private copy of the Kroki server](https://docs.kroki.io/kroki/setup/install/) in your environment and set the `KROKI_SERVER_URL` environment variable to use yours instead.

# Example Mermaid Diagrams

## Class diagrams

Class diagrams are a type of UML diagram that visually represent
the relationships between classes in a software system. They show
the classes, their attributes, and the methods they contain, as
well as the relationships between them, such as inheritance,
association, and aggregation. Class diagrams are used to model the
static structure of a system, providing a blueprint for its
implementation.

```mermaid
classDiagram
Entity <|-- Product
Entity <|-- Customer
Entity <|-- Vendor
Vendor <|-- Store
Entity <|-- Project
```

## Pie charts

Pie charts are a type of chart that displays data as slices of a
circle, where the size of each slice is proportional to the value
it represents.  They are useful for visualizing the relative
proportions of different categories within a dataset.  This example
shows the relative time spent looking for a movie versus watching
it on Netflix.


```mermaid
pie title NETFLIX
    "Time spent looking for movie" : 90
    "Time spent watching it" : 10
```

## Sequence diagrams

UML Sequence diagrams are a type of interaction diagram that shows
how objects in a system interact with each other over time. They
are used to model the dynamic behavior of a system, showing the
sequence of messages that are exchanged between objects. Sequence
diagrams are often used to model the flow of control in a system,
such as the steps involved in processing a request or handling an
event.


```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice ->> Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
    Bob-->>John: How about you John?
    Bob--x Alice: I am good thanks!
    Bob-x John: I am good thanks!
    Note right of John: Bob thinks a long<br/>long time, so long<br/>that the text does<br/>not fit on a row.

    Bob-->Alice: Checking with John...
    Alice->John: Yes... John, how are you?
```

## Mindmaps

Mindmaps are a visual representation of hierarchical information,
using branches radiating from a central node to represent relationships
between concepts. They are often used for brainstorming, note-taking,
and knowledge organization, allowing users to visually map out ideas
and connections. Mindmaps can be created using pen and paper or
specialized software tools like Mermaid.

A timeline is a type of diagram that visually represents events and
activities over a period of time. It is used to illustrate the
sequence of events, milestones, or tasks in a project or process,
providing a clear overview of the timeline and dependencies.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'forest' } }%%
    timeline

          2002 : LinkedIn
          2004 : Facebook : Google

          2006 : Twitter
          2007 : Tumblr
          2008 : Instagram

Quadrant diagrams are a visual representation of a matrix with four
quadrants, each representing a different combination of two variables.
They are often used for prioritization, decision-making, and
problem-solving.

A quadrant diagram typically has two axes, each representing a
different variable. The axes are usually labeled with opposite ends
of a spectrum, such as "Important" vs. "Not Important" or "Urgent"
vs. "Not Urgent". The four quadrants are then defined by the
intersection of these axes.


```mermaid

%%{init: {"quadrantChart": {"chartWidth": 400, "chartHeight": 400}, "themeVariables": {"quadrant1TextFill": "#ff0000"} }}%%
quadrantChart
  x-axis Urgent --> Not Urgent
  y-axis Not Important --> "Important ‚ù§"
  quadrant-1 Plan
  quadrant-2 Do
  quadrant-3 Delegate
  quadrant-4 Delete
```
